## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.table("C:/Rstudy/Introduction to Regression Analysis/datasets/salary-1.txt", header = T);
str(df)
a <- factor(df$Degree)
levels(a) <- c("Bachelor", "Master", "Doctor")
df$Degree <- a
str(df)
cor(df[,c(1, 3, 4)])

# result 1
result1 <- lm(salary~Degree + Years + Num, data = df)
summary(result1) # R^2: 0.8632


# result 2
df$log_sal <- log(df$salary) 
result2 <- lm(log_sal~Degree+Years+Num, data = df)
summary(result2) # R^2: 0.8493 -> 지우고 난 후 R^2: 0.8624


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(df)
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2))
plot(result1)

layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2))
plot(result2) # R vs F.V not bad, QQ plot better


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
