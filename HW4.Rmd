## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.delim("C:/Rstudy/Introduction to Regression Analysis/datasets/education1970.txt", 
                 header=T)
row.names(df) = df[,1]
df = df[,2:6]
region <- df[,5]; region
region[region == 1] = "Northeast"
region[region == 2] = "North Central"
region[region == 3] = "South"
region[region == 4] = "West"
region
region_fac <- factor(region, levels = c("Northeast", "North Central", "South", "West"))

df[,5] <- region_fac;
plot(df)
cor(df[,1:4])
library(HH)
vif(df[2:4])

result_a <- lm(Y~X1+X2+X3, data = df[,1:4])
summary(result_a)

result_e <- lm(Y~X1+X2+X3+Region, data = df); summary(result_e)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
result_a <- lm(Y~X1+X2+X3, data = df[,1:4])
summary(result_a)
plot(result_a, 1)
plot(result_a, 2)
plot(result_a, 4)
plot(result_a, 5)

plot(result_e, 1)
plot(result_e, 2)
plot(result_e, 4)
plot(result_e, 5)

plot(df[,c(5, 2)])

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
